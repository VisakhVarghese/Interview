/**
 * Throughput: The rate at which a system processes tasks or data within a given timeframe.
 * Latency: The time delay between initiating a request and receiving a response.
 * Coupling: The degree of interdependence between software modules or components.
 * Scalability: The ability of a system to handle increased workload by adding resources.
 * Concurrency: The ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously.
 * Response Time: The total time taken to respond to a request, including processing and latency.
 * Efficiency: The ability of a system to accomplish tasks with minimal waste of resources.
 * Reliability: The ability of a system to perform consistently and predictably over time.
 * Availability: The proportion of time that a system is operational and accessible.
 * Fault Tolerance: The ability of a system to continue operating in the event of a failure.
 * Bottleneck: A point in a system where the flow of data or processing is limited, reducing overall performance.
 * Load Balancing: Distributing workloads across multiple computing resources to optimize resource utilization.
 * Redundancy: Duplication of critical components or systems to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.
 * Cache: A mechanism for storing data temporarily to reduce access latency and improve performance.
 * Instrumentation: Adding monitoring and measurement capabilities to a system to gather performance data.
 * Resilience: The ability of a system to recover quickly and continue operating effectively after encountering problems.
 * Profiling: The process of analyzing a program's behavior and performance characteristics,
 * often to identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
 * Security: Measures and practices implemented to protect a system or software from unauthorized access, attacks,
 * and vulnerabilities.
 * Version Control: Systems and practices used to track and manage changes to source code over time,
 * facilitating collaboration and code management.
 * Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD): Practices and tools used to automate
 * and streamline the process of software development, testing, and deployment.
 * Response Time: The time taken by a system to respond to a request or perform an action.
 * Uptime: The total time a system has been running without interruptions.
 * Downtime: The total time a system is unavailable or non-operational.
 * Error Rate: The frequency of errors occurring in a system, often expressed as a percentage or number of errors per time unit.
 * Load Time: The time taken for a system or application to start up or for a webpage to load.
 * CPU Utilization: The percentage of CPU capacity being used by a system.
 * Memory Utilization: The percentage of memory being used by a system.
 * Network Bandwidth Utilization: The percentage of network capacity being used by a system.
 * Disk I/O: The rate at which data is read from and written to disk storage.
 * Queue Length: The number of tasks waiting to be processed in a system.
 * Code Coverage: The percentage of code that is tested by automated tests.
 * Defect Density: The number of defects found in a system per unit of size (e.g., per thousand lines of code).
 * Mean Time to Failure (MTTF): The average time between failures of a system.
 * Mean Time to Repair (MTTR): The average time taken to repair a system after a failure.
 * Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): A measure of user satisfaction with a system, often gathered through surveys.
 * Net Promoter Score (NPS): A measure of customer loyalty and satisfaction, based on the likelihood of users recommending the system to others.
 * Cohesion: Refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single module are.
 * High cohesion within modules is desired for better maintainability and understandability.
 * Modularity: Measures the extent to which a system's components can be separated and recombined.
 * High modularity typically implies easier maintenance and scalability.
 * Flexibility: Indicates how easily the architecture can adapt to changing requirements or incorporate new features.
 * Maintainability: Measures how easily the system can be maintained, including the ease of fixing bugs, making enhancements, and updating the system.
 * Reusability: Assesses the extent to which components or modules can be reused in different parts of the system or in other systems.
 * Performance: Evaluates how well the system meets its performance requirements, including metrics such as response time, throughput, and latency.
 * Extensibility: Indicates how easily new functionality can be added to the system without significant changes to the existing architecture.
 * Complexity: Evaluates the difficulty of understanding, developing, and maintaining the system. Lower complexity is generally better for long-term maintenance.
 * Interoperability: Measures the ability of the system to interact and work with other systems or components. This includes adherence to standards and protocols
 * Resource Utilization: Measures how efficiently the system uses resources such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
 * Compliance: Evaluates the system's adherence to relevant standards, regulations, and best practices.
 * Testability: Assesses how easily the system can be tested, including the ease of creating and executing tests for individual components and the system as a whole.

/**
 * "Coupling" in software engineering refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules or components.
 * It describes how closely connected or dependent one module is on another.
 *
 * There are generally two types of coupling:
 *
 * Tight Coupling: This occurs when modules are highly dependent on each other.
 * Changes in one module may require changes in other modules, leading to potential fragility and difficulty
 * in maintaining or modifying the codebase.
 *
 * Loose Coupling: This occurs when modules are relatively independent of each other.
 * Each module operates independently and communicates with others through well-defined interfaces or protocols.
 * This reduces dependencies and allows for easier maintenance, testing, and scalability of the software system.
 *
 * Reducing coupling is often desirable in software design because it promotes modularity, flexibility,
 * and reusability of code, making the system more adaptable to changes and improvements over time.
