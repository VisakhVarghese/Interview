/**
 * A connection pool in Java is a cache of database connections maintained
 * so that the connections can be reused when future requests to the database are required.
 * This reduces the overhead of establishing a new connection every time a database interaction is needed,
 * which can be costly in terms of time and resources.
 *
 * Key Features of Connection Pools:
 * Efficiency: Reusing existing connections instead of creating new ones each time improves
 * the performance of database-driven applications.
 *
 * Resource Management: Connection pools help manage the limited number of database connections efficiently,
 * avoiding issues like connection exhaustion.
 *
 * Configuration: Connection pools can be configured with parameters such as the maximum number of connections,
 * the minimum number of idle connections, and the maximum idle time for a connection.
 *
 * Thread Safety: Most connection pools are designed to be thread-safe,
 * meaning multiple threads can request and return connections simultaneously without conflict.

/**
 * How It Works:
 * Initialization: When the application starts, the connection pool is initialized with a certain number of connections to the database.
 *
 * Request Handling: When an application needs to interact with the database, it requests a connection from the pool.
 *
 * Connection Usage: The application uses the connection to perform the required database operations.
 *
 * Return to Pool: Once the database operations are complete, the connection is returned to the pool, making it available for future requests.

 * Popular Java Connection Pool Libraries:
 * HikariCP: Known for its high performance and low latency.
 * Apache DBCP: Part of the Apache Commons project.
 * C3P0: Offers features like automatic reconnection and statement caching.
 * Tomcat JDBC: Used in Apache Tomcat, a lightweight and fast connection pool.
