/**
 * Java Mission Control (JMC) is a powerful set of tools for managing, monitoring, profiling,
 * and troubleshooting Java applications. JMC is primarily used by developers and system administrators
 * to optimize and understand the performance characteristics of their Java applications.
 * It comes with the Java Development Kit (JDK) and is designed to work with the Java Flight Recorder (JFR),
 * which is a low-overhead, data collection framework for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
 *
 * Key Features of Java Mission Control (JMC)
 * Java Flight Recorder (JFR) Integration: JMC works seamlessly with JFR,
 * allowing you to collect detailed performance data about your Java applications with minimal impact on performance.
 * JFR records events such as method execution times, memory usage, thread activity, and garbage collection.
 *
 * Real-time Monitoring: JMC provides real-time monitoring capabilities,
 * enabling you to observe the performance of your Java applications as they run.
 * This includes tracking CPU usage, memory consumption, and other key metrics.
 *
 * Profiling: JMC allows you to profile your Java applications to identify performance bottlenecks and hotspots.
 * This includes method profiling, which helps you understand which parts of your code are consuming the most resources.
 *
 * Heap Analysis: JMC includes tools for analyzing the heap memory usage of your Java applications.
 * This can help you identify memory leaks and optimize memory allocation.
 *
 * Thread Analysis: JMC provides detailed insights into thread activity, including thread states,
 * blocking issues, and contention problems. This is useful for diagnosing threading issues in multi-threaded applications.
 *
 * Event Browser: JMC includes an event browser that lets you examine the events recorded by JFR.
 * his includes detailed information about each event, such as timestamps, event types, and associated data.
 *
 * Rule-based Analysis: JMC includes a set of predefined rules that can automatically analyze the
 * collected data and provide recommendations for improving application performance and stability.
 *
 * User-friendly Interface: JMC features a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes
 * it easy to visualize and analyze performance data. The interface includes various charts, graphs, and tables to help you understand the data.

/**
 * Conclusion
 * Java Mission Control (JMC) is a comprehensive toolset for monitoring, profiling,
 * and troubleshooting Java applications. Its integration with Java Flight Recorder (JFR)
 * allows developers to collect and analyze detailed performance data with minimal overhead,
 * making it an essential tool for optimizing Java applications. By providing real-time monitoring, profiling,
 * heap and thread analysis, and rule-based recommendations,
 * JMC helps developers ensure their Java applications run efficiently and reliably.
